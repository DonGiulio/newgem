0.8.0 - Uses hoe itself - less hypocritical
      - Generated test files use name 'test_<gemname>.rb' instead of '<gemname>_test.rb' to support
        ZenTest's autotest expectations of naming. Manifest updated too.

0.7.1 - Installed gems now don't require 'hoe' (based on comments at http://blog.evanweaver.com/articles/2007/01/10/if-you-dont-want-to-hoe-echoe)
