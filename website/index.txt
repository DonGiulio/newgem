h1. New Gem Generator

h1. &#x2192; 'newgem'

h2. What

Quickly bundle any Ruby libraries into a RubyGem and share it with the world, your colleagues, or perhaps just with yourself amongst your projects.

RubyGems are centrally stored, versioned, and support dependencies between other gems, so they are the ultimate way to bundle libraries, executables, associated tests, examples, and more.

Within this gem, you get one thing - <code>newgem</code> - an executable to create your own gems. Your new gems will include designated folders for Ruby code, test files, executables, and even a default website page for you to explain your project, and which instantly uploads to RubyForge website (which looks just like this one by default)

h2. Installing

The <code>newgem</code> application is distributed itself as a RubyGem and is available immediately after installation.

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install newgem</pre>

Alternately, download the gem and install manually.

h2. The basics

Go to the folder where you want to create your new gem folder structure, and run the <code>newgem</code> command to generate your gem scaffolding.

<pre>$ cd ~/ruby_projects
$ newgem wizzo
creating: wizzo
creating: wizzo/CHANGELOG.txt
creating: wizzo/README.txt
creating: wizzo/lib
creating: wizzo/scripts
creating: wizzo/website
creating: wizzo/website/javascripts
creating: wizzo/website/stylesheets
creating: wizzo/lib/wizzo
creating: wizzo/lib/wizzo.rb
creating: wizzo/lib/wizzo/version.rb
creating: wizzo/bin
creating: wizzo/test
creating: wizzo/test/test_helper.rb
creating: wizzo/test/test_wizzo.rb
creating: wizzo/examples
creating: wizzo/setup.rb
creating: wizzo/Rakefile
creating: wizzo/Manifest.txt
creating: wizzo/History.txt
creating: wizzo/scripts/txt2html
creating: wizzo/website/index.txt
creating: wizzo/website/template.rhtml
copying: wizzo/website/javascripts/rounded_corners_lite.inc.js
copying: wizzo/website/stylesheets/screen.css
NOW - update wizzo/Rakefile with gem description, etc
</pre>

h3. Setup

Now modify the constants at the top of *Rakefile*, with your name, email and the location where you'll host your website for the gem. The defaults are tied to RubyForge for uploading the gems and the website (see below).

h3. Create code and tests

Then create your libraries (files in <code>lib</code>) and your tests (files in <code>test</code> that look like <code>test_TESTNAME.rb</code>). John Grey III did a nice video on test-driven design, that's worth watching if TDD is new to you.

If you create any new files, you need to manually add them to the Manifest.txt. Alphabetical order is optional, but it will make the results of <code>rake check_manifest</code> look clean if you keep them ordered. If a file is not in the Manifest.txt it will not be included in the gem when you package and release it.

h3. Executables

You can include executable Ruby applications in your gem, which will be accessible on Windows and Unix/Linux/MacOS, by creating scripts in the <code>bin</code> folder. When the gem is deployed by users, these executables will be automatically placed within their path.

h3. Website

The final step before releasing your gem to the world is the all-important website. Edit the file <code>website/index.txt</code> using Textile/Redcloth syntax. Syntax highlighting is also supported (see below). If you need more website pages, create more *.txt files in the website folder. 

Run the rake task <code>rake website_generate</code> to convert all your website txt files into html files.

The rake task <code>rake website_upload</code> will upload the website into a RubyForge project. The task <code>website</code> performs both the generation and the upload.

If you don't want a website, remove the <code>website</code> related files from the Manifest.txt. 

Make sure you've generated the <code>website/index.html</code> file before continuing to package and release your gem (unless you remove it from the Manifest.txt).
