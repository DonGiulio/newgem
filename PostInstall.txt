USAGE: newgem project_name
HELP/OPTIONS: newgem -h


newgem can use an environment variable $RUBYFORGE_USERNAME
for its default. So you can add the following to your .bash_profile:

  export RUBYFORGE_USERNAME="nicwilliams"

Did you know you have script/generate generators?
  application_generator, component_generator, executable,
  extconf, install_cucumber, install_jruby, install_rspec,
  install_website, test_unit

Have fun making RubyGems!
